        text: 'Not long after, we relaunched the Fidelis website built on a cutting edge Statamic stack, giving Fidelis a fully custom content management system, relieving one of the major pain points of their earlier experience. Previously they''d been on Wordpress, and of course their old site was riddled with bugs, outdated plugins, prone to malware, and severly limited in how the design could scale. Customers typically left after a single page visit, since there was zero contextual content-to-content navigation. It was bleak.'

        text: 'An audiophile walks into a store... ostensibly to buy some cables... and casually mentions to the owner that their current website is not up to par with the beautiful equipment they sell. Yep, that was me. Before I knew it I''d agreed to make them a new website in exchange for the (crazy high end) cables. I''ve enjoyed a standing discount ever since; alchemically transforming design into high end music gear is a dream come true.'
