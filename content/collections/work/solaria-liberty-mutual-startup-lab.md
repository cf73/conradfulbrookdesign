        text: 'Aside from the standard aspects of bootstrapping a digital product like this (IA, flows, UX/UI), we were able to differentiate the product significantly — and thus drive conversion — through innovative design. Moving pricing estimates to the first point of engagement, rather than burying them in a "Get a Quote" flow, turned out to be a breakthrough in a market where every other company promises a quote "in less than five minutes", with the reality being closer to 20. Users were willing to accept a margin of error of up to 30% just to get a ballpark figure sooner, and this perceived level of transparency then drove them to engage with the brand, with all test participants in multiple sessions indicating that from this starting point they would continue to ''Customize'' (as we positioned it) their quote.'

large_intro_textNEW: "Solaria is an incubator startup based out of Liberty Mutual. Its product, 'Certainly', is a suite of insurance products aimed at millennials. In a crowded market, they turned to Mad*Pow (a leading Boston and Portsmouth-based design agency) to help discover how they might differentiate their product and connect with their target market."
