large_intro_textNEW: 'Where most navigation apps present lists of passively-consumed route options, often in a very dense cluster of small icons and without a map, this project explored a ''constructionist'' approach to routing. Common in pedagogy, constructionism posits that we understand best when we actively create knowledge. Given that navigation is often a taxing and stressful activity, I wanted to see if we could find a more intuitive approach, with the user actively generating their route based on the parameters that matter to them (time, cost, memberships, even CO2 emissions).'
