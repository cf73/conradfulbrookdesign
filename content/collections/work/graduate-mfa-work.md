        text: "While pursuing an MFA in Graphic Design at RISD, I explored 'experience design' in its widest sense. Subsequently translated into digital product design, often allied to behavior change strategies, this background nonetheless provided me with a profound understanding of underlying principles of designing for human experience, and opened avenues of personal inquiry into Actor Network Theory, Enactivism, Complexity Theory, Semiotics, Systems, and relational epistemologies such as Buddhism."
